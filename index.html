			<h1>Public Prayers</h1>
			<div id="aboutBlogDescription">
				<p>
					A <strong>prayer</strong> has traditionally been a message to God that you utter with your voice, or think silently in your head.
					But in a world where I talk to people through digital text more often than I do with my voice, I feel like it might be
					interesting to try a new form of prayer that reflects how many people <em>really</em> 'talk'. God is omniscient (all-knowing).
					He knows what we pray before we even pray it. He has access to every database, including this
				one :)
				</p>
				<p>
					<span title="And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners
to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the
door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. (NIV)">Matthew 6:5-6</span> makes a point that prayers are not supposed to be flashy public shows of piety. I am aware that my sinful heart could
					twist this blog into a modern rendition of that ancient hypocrisy. Therefore, the majority of prayers in this system will be
					kept on private, accessible only through a secret URL that can be shared around as necessary.
